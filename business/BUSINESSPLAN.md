# UNISWAP Lean Canvas

In lieu of writing a full business plan, we have created a 1-page business model that uses the Lean Canvas model. The Lean Canvas provides a concise framework that emphasizes key elements of business concepts and condenses information into a sindle, easily digestible model that focuses on essential components like customer segments, value propositions, and revenue streams. More information about the Lean Canvas can be found at [Lean Canvas](https://www.leancanvas.com).
