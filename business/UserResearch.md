# User Research Observations

The following observations are made based on feedback on [this survey](https://forms.gle/rFPLNKVMVNnLjC4W7).

## Observation 1:
* Users want some guarantees and policies to protect themselves in a trade.
* From our responses, we can see that users want return policies, guarantees that an item is in the condition it's advertised as, and ratings of traders.
* As a team, we can implement guidelines for users to abide by, and a rating system so that users will know if a trader can be trusted.

## Observation 2:
* Users have concerns about their safety during trades
* The majority of responses indicated that they lean towards having safety concerns during trades. However, most respondents do feel comfortable meeting people on campus. In the short answer question asking users for how we should address their safety concerns, many respondents indicated that a public meeting place, preferably on campus, during a specified time range, would make them feel safer during trades.
* In response, our team will include a list of safe, public meeting places and times that the users will select and agree on before each exchange.

## Observation 3:
* Trading usually occurs between friends and family.
* Only 62.5% of people have traded before.
* To address people who are unfamiliar with trading we will implement step-by-step guidelines in addition to an easy-to-use platform.
