# User Research Observations

The following observations are made based on feedback on [this survey](https://forms.gle/rFPLNKVMVNnLjC4W7).

## Observation 1:
* Users want some guarantees and policies to protect themselves in a trade.
* From our responses, we can see that users want return policies, guarantees that an item is in the condition it's advertised as, and ratings of traders.
* As a team, we can implement guidelines for users to abide by, and a rating system so that users will know if a trader can be trusted.
