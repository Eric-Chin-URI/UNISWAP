## Happiness

### Surveys & Feedback Forms

To gauge general satisfaction with the app, users will be asked to fill out **Google Form surveys** regarding their experience.


### Post trade ratings

A week after each trade, users will be asked to rate their trading experience on a scale with optional additional feedback. This will be an **in-app pop-up** that will be **stored in Firebase**.


### Overall app rating

Users will be encouraged to rate the app in the **App Store**.

- Metric 1: Collect Data Regarding User-to-User Messaging
<p> The main focus of our application is to ensure that users can communicate with each other when trading items. By tracking the number of times a user messages another user to initiate a trade, it is important to track the number of ongoing messages within a given timeframe. This can help our team understand any possible barriers or redesign the way users can communicate through our platform. In response, this could benefit our application's traffic in the future based on this crucial statistic.</p>

- Metric 2: Number of Downloads / Sign Ups
<p>A metric that will help us gauge adoption of our application is the number of downloads and sign-ups we have. In order to track this, we can use Google Analytics to measure how many users we have and analyze the trends over time. Using this data, we'll be able to track the success of our app and make appropriate changes.</p>
