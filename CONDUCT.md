# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As a team, we will abide by diversity and inclusion welcoming practices within our group. We will ensure to maintain an open and communicative environment within our team.  

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrate positive and cooperative teamwork

## Enforcement Responsibilities

A Scrum Master is responsible for maintaining sprint requirements, project story expectations, and team facilitating through weekly sprints. As a leader, the Scrum Master will enforce our team standards amongst all developers within these rights. If there is a given situation where a developer extends the standards in an uncooperative manner, the Scrum Master has the right to proceed appropriately.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
